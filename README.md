## üìù Description
This desktop application, built with Python and its standard Tkinter library, dynamically generates intricate mazes using a **recursive backtracking algorithm**. Following generation, it provides an interactive visualization of the maze being solved, demonstrating a valid path from start to finish using a **Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm**.

## ü§î Why? (Motivation/Goal)
This project was developed primarily as a practical exercise to deepen understanding and visualize two fundamental computer science algorithms: recursive backtracking for maze generation and depth-first search for pathfinding. It aims to provide an interactive and engaging way to observe these algorithms in action within a graphical user interface, making abstract concepts more concrete and accessible.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To get this maze generator and solver up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.x:** (Tested with Python 3.8 and newer). You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Tkinter:** Usually bundled with Python installations. If you encounter issues (e.g., "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'"), you might need to install it via your operating system's package manager.
    * **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
    * **macOS (with Homebrew Python):** `brew install python-tk` (or `brew install python` if Tkinter is missing)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Josephus-git/Maze_solver.git
    cd maze_solver
    ```

2.  **No further `pip` installations are strictly required** as the project primarily relies on standard Python libraries.

### Running the Application

From the `maze_solver/` root directory:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## üí° Usage
Once the application window appears:
1. **Observe Maze Generation**: The application will first display the maze being generated dynamically, step-by-step, using an animated process. Walls will be removed as the algorithm explores.

2. **Solve the Maze**: After the maze generation is complete, a "Solve Maze" button will appear at the bottom center of the window. Click this button to initiate the maze-solving algorithm.

3. **Watch the Solution**: The application will then animate the depth-first search algorithm as it finds a path from the top-left cell (start) to the bottom-right cell (exit) of the maze.

   * **Red lines** indicate forward progress along the potential solution path.
   * **Grey lines** indicate backtracking when a dead end is reached.
